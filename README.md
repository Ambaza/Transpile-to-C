# Transpile-to-C
Let's consider a simple transpiler for a subset of a high-level language to C. We'll add a basic garbage collector (GC) to showcase the addition of high-level features not native to C.
the CTranspiler class transpiles a simple arithmetic expression into C code. The generated C code includes the necessary header files and converts the high-level operations into C syntax.
